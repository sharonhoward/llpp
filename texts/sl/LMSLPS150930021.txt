To the Right Honourable William Plomer Esquire Lord Mayor of the City of London Sir Thomas Hallifax Knight one of the Aldermen of the said City James Adair serjeant at Law Recorder of the said City Thomas Wright Esquire one other of the Aldermen of the said City and others their Fellows Justices of our Lord the King assigned to keep the Peace within the said City.

The Memorial of the Principal and Antients of the Society of Staple Inn

Whereas by an order made at the General Quarter Sessions of the Peace for the City of London by adjournment on the fourteenth day of January last the Sum of Seventeen Pounds was declared to be assessed and taxed eateably and Proportionably on the several Inhabitants within Staple Inn towards an Equal Distribution to be had and made for the relief of the several Defendants in the said order mentioned who had delivered Executions for their Damages and Costs sustained as in the said order likewise mentioned

Your Memorialists represent that they have always Considered a very small part only of the said Inn as standing within the Limits of the City of London and that notwithstanding the most deligent enquiry they have made in consequence of the said order they cannot specify and as certain what part of the said Inn is within the Limits of the City and what part within the County of Middlesex and therefore are unable to proportion and assess the said Sum of Seventeen Pounds upon and amongst the several persons who may be liable to pay the same

For these Reasons therefore they find themselves not sufficiently informed to authorize them to make and collect the rate required by the said order and are under the Necessity of requesting that the particular part of the said Inn which is deemed to be included in the said Order may be ascertained and pointed out to your Memorialists.
